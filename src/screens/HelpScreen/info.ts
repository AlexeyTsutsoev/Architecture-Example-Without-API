  - These are five takes that have helped Resellers kick-start their businesses:

 
  - Task 1: Have a store name. You are now a business, you need to think like one. Every business has a name. Coming up with a name can be hard, but it must be simple, and catchy. For example – Thandie Resells cosmetics, she has named her Store BeauTee.
  
  - Task 2: Create a WhatsApp Group for your store. Start by adding family and friends. They are supportive when you start something new. Tell them that you have started a new business and would love to get their feedback. When you share products with them, they will let you know whether they like what you’re selling or not.
  
  - Task 3: Find Products. You need to be at the forefront of finding products. Your community depends on you to bring them the latest and the freshest items. You have to be on high alert always. Browse the Khoyn Discover page.
  
  - Task 4: Create the URGENCY FACTOR. Use phrases like, “I have only a few of these left” or “ I can offer 20% off till tonight” . The purpose is toensure that your customers see what they like and creating an urgencywill help them determine their purchase.
  
  - Task 5: The Secret Recipe. Focus on building a loyal customer base. Begin with marking low profits and gradually increase it. This has worked for many successful Resellers.
  
  - Importantly, create your own WhatsApp Group. Think of the group as your version of a physical store. That is where customers will shop from. Create your store groups and you can share products you find onthe app.`,
